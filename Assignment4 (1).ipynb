    "As hopefully you have found in your experience and through the course instruction, what goes in a prompt dictates the quality of the output.  Therefore, it is important that we learn to iterate on our prompting design and evaluate the quality of different types of prompts for different instruction types.\n",

    "To that end, in this exercise you will compare different prompt inputs and consider the resulting differences in output presented by an LLM.  Specifically, use ChatGPT to explore different prompt types (e.g., zero vs. few shot prompting) for 3 of the different interaction types.\n",

    "Use the following reference for the different types of tasks and examples to guide your own prompt.  Additional details about prompting techniques (e.g., zero-shot) and examples for each is avabalbe in the site navigation list on the left side of the website:\n",
